inSALMO Version 1.5, May 2013.

This software implements version 1.5 of the inSALMO individual-based salmon model. The model represents effects of river habitat on freshwater life stages of salmon, from spawning through outmigration of juveniles. 

Version 1.5 implements several model revisions plus bug fixes. The revisions are outlined below and will be documented in an updated model description to be published in May, 2013.

The previous version number 1.2 resulted from several bug-fixes; the code still implemented v. 1.0 of the model description. That version of the model is thoroughly documented in the report "inSALMO Version 1.0: Model Improvements and Demonstration Application to Chinook Salmon Spawning, Incubation, and Rearing in Clear Creek, California" prepared by Lang, Railsback & Associates and USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for US Bureau of Reclamation, under Contract R09PS20027, Improvement of Salmon Life-Cycle Framework Model (inSALMO).

Version 1.5 includes these modifications from v. 1.0:

1) In the outmigration action, juveniles moving downstream into a new reach 
 (a) choose a cell randomly out of all those in the reach with velocity < maxSwimSpeed, not just those at the upper end, and 
 (b) move only one reach per day.
2) Adults are no longer forced to spawn on last day of spawning window.
3) Parameter changes:
 (a) fishSpawnProb varied in an experiment; value of 0.08 best reproduces time series of outmigrant lengths
 (b) New aquatic predation parameters to better reflect Clear Creek habitat and predators
4) New input for adult initialization that is modified (from Spawning Area Mapping data) to better reflect actual spawner distributions.
