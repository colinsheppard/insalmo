inSALMO Version 1.0, October 2011.

This software implements version 1.0 of the inSALMO individual-based salmon model. The model represents effects of river habitat on freshwater life stages of salmon, from spawning through outmigration of juveniles.

The model is thoroughly documented in the report "inSALMO Version 1.0:
Model Improvements and Demonstration Application to Chinook Salmon Spawning, Incubation, and Rearing in Clear Creek, California" prepared by Lang, Railsback & Associates and USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for US Bureau of Reclamation, under Contract R09PS20027, Improvement of Salmon Life-Cycle Framework Model (inSALMO).
