inSALMO Version 1.2, May 2012.

This software implements version 1.0 of the inSALMO individual-based salmon model. The 
model represents effects of river habitat on freshwater life stages of salmon, from 
spawning through outmigration of juveniles. (The version number 1.2 results from
several bug-fixes; the code still implements v. 1.0 of the model description.)

The model is thoroughly documented in the report "inSALMO Version 1.0:
Model Improvements and Demonstration Application to Chinook Salmon Spawning, Incubation, 
and Rearing in Clear Creek, California" prepared by Lang, Railsback & Associates and 
USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for US Bureau of Reclamation, 
under Contract R09PS20027, Improvement of Salmon Life-Cycle Framework Model (inSALMO).
